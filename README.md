## 2. Why we create Leanote

We have been using the popular note-taking software/service `Evernote` as our knowledge management tool on a daily basis. Benefited from and inspired by `Evernote`, we decided to create a brand-new tool that provides everything `Evernote` has to offer, plus a bunch of new features that `Evernote` failed to deliver, such as:

* A more powerful editor: `Evernote`'s editor lacks the functionalities of **document navigation**, **syntax based code rendering** (as a programmer, syntax highlighted code rendering is a necessity), **image resizing** and so forth.

* [Leanote Desktop App](https://github.com/leanote/desktop-app), [Download](http://app.leanote.com)
* [Leanote iOS](https://github.com/leanote/leanote-ios), [Download From App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/leanote/id1022302858?mt=8)
* [Leanote Android](https://github.com/leanote/leanote-android), development phase
